# Shell-Scripting
Shell scripting is the process of writing and executing a series of instructions in a shell to automate tasks. A shell script is essentially a script or program written in a shell language, such as Bash, sh, zsh, or PowerShell?

A basic shell script that will create multiple folders and create multiple linux users at once would look like this.

```
#!/bin/bash

# Create directories
mkdir Folder1
mkdir Folder2
mkdir Folder3
```
